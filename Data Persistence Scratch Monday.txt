Client Side Storage: at 
browser/user computer
- local username/pwd if you trust
- pictures
- what is in my CART shopping



Server Side Storage: at
a central server
- email addresses that identifies their account
- Any app related information that even others may need
- if you need to access from anywhere in the world
